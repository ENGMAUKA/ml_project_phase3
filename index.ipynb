    "# **1. Overview**\n",
    "Tanzania, a developing nation, faces challenges in supplying its more than 57,000,000 inhabitants with water that is safe for drinking. It is extremely difficult for people to find clean, sanitary water if they do not reside close to one of the three large lakes that border the country, as one-third of the country is arid to semi-arid. Consequently, Tanzanians rely heavily on groundwater as their primary supply of water;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) standards, just 61% of Tanzanian households presently have access to a basic water supply, 32% to basic sanitation, and 48% to basic hygiene. As a direct result, Tanzania has had to deal with mortality and illness, with the poor and vulnerable, women, and children bearing the brunt of this burden. Inadequate WASH services are thought to be the cause of 31,000 fatalities annually in Tanzania, accounting for almost 10% of avoidable deaths. These deaths also cost the country more than $2.4 billion annually in lost productivity and additional medical expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nation already has a large number of water points (stations), but some of them require maintenance, while others have completely failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to builds classification model, using an iterative approach, to predict the condition of water wells in Tanzania. The dataset for modelling was obtained from data provided by Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of water. \n",

    "Victoria Inc. has been procured by the Government of Tanzania on a consultancy basis to study the severe water crisis experienced by the country and propose a data driven solution to clean water accessibility. Victoria Inc. is tasked with coming up with a  model that predicts the operating condition of the water points. This model will assist the government to:\n",
    "- Prioritize maintenance and repairs based on operating status;\n",
    "- Understand the failure rate of the water points;\n",
    "- Optimize allocation of resources to restore the water points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of Victoria Inc is to:\n",
